# Water flip 4-H experiments

**Repository**: github.com/ChuckBV/ad_hoc/Y19-4h-stem-expts

Examines two sets of experiments over three meetings in March 2019 in which
empirical data were collected to test received wisdom about the importance
of some factors in success of the water bottle flip. Factors examined were
the volume of water in the bottle and the shape of the bottle.
